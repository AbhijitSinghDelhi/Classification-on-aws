# Classification-on-aws
Upload,train,test,deploy,Predict and delete data on aws
Here's a summary of the code provided:

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - Import necessary libraries including SageMaker, Boto3, Pandas, Numpy, and others.
   - Define the S3 bucket name and region.

2. **S3 Bucket Creation**:
   - Create an S3 bucket to store the data and model artifacts.
   - Handle region-specific constraints while creating the bucket.

3. **Downloading and Loading Data**:
   - Download a dataset from a URL and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Handle potential errors during the download and loading process.

4. **Splitting Data**:
   - Randomly split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

5. **Uploading Data to S3**:
   - Convert training and testing data to CSV files.
   - Upload the CSV files to the S3 bucket.
   - Define `TrainingInput` objects for the training and testing data.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Define the XGBoost container image URI.
   - Specify hyperparameters for the XGBoost model.
   - Create an `Estimator` object for the XGBoost model.
   - Train the model using the training data, specifying instance type and other configurations.

7. **Model Deployment and Predictions**:
   - Deploy the trained model to an endpoint.
   - Make predictions on the test data using the deployed endpoint.
   - Handle the prediction output and convert it to a NumPy array.

8. **Evaluation**:
   - Create a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Calculate and print the overall classification rate and other metrics.

9. **Cleanup**:
   - Delete the deployed endpoint.
   - Delete all objects in the S3 bucket to clean up resources.
